The plan \\nprovides a pre-set automated mechanism for participants to acquire shares, recognising that Non-executive Directors can often \\nbe limited in their ability to purchase shares because of Australian insider trading laws. Non-executive Director share rights are \\nallocated quarterly at the same time as the underlying shares are issued to the plan’s trustee. For Australian-based directors, \\nthese rights convert into ordinary shares each half year; and for US-based directors, these rights convert into shares at the end \\nof the director’s tenure or other prescribed events (with additional shares equivalent to the dividends that would have been \\nearned and reinvested on those rights), subject to compliance with the Securities Trading policy. \\nThe plan supports the minimum shareholding requirement for Board members as it allows Non-executive Directors to reach \\nthe minimum shareholding requirements more quickly, as shares are acquired on a pre-tax basis. Details of the share rights \\nallocated to Non-executive Directors are set out in Section 5.2.\\nThe Group will be seeking shareholder approval to continue this plan for a further three years at the 2021 AGM.70\\nRemuneration Report\\n5 KMP STATUTORY DISCLOSURES \\n5.1   KMP REMUNERATION\\nThe table below sets out the remuneration of Non-executive Directors of Woolworths Group Limited.

non-executive director share rights are \\nallocated quarterly at the same time as the underlying shares are issued to the plan’s trustee. for australian-based directors, \\nthese rights convert into ordinary shares each half year; and for us-based directors, these rights convert into shares at the end \\nof the director’s tenure or other prescribed events (with additional shares equivalent to the dividends that would have been \\nearned and reinvested on those rights), subject to compliance with the securities trading policy. \\nthe plan supports the minimum shareholding requirement for board
